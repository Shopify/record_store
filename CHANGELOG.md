# CHANGELOG

## 7.0.0
- Validate that there are no A/AAAA record conflicts with ALIAS records

## 6.7.2
- Fix ActiveModel::Error usage for validate_records (behaviour change in ActiveModel 7)

# 6.7.1
- Change update_record to update_zone_record for DNSimple

## 6.7.0

## 6.5.5
- Include DNSimple validation error details in exceptions

## 6.5.4
- Updates config path structure for build pipeline

## 6.5.3
- Adds check for detecting shadowed records, used when a record being added to a zone in record-store will have no effect because it is shadowed by another record.

## 6.5.2
- Ensure filters for implicit_records, `except_record` and `conflict_with`, are truly optional [BUGFIX]

## 6.5.1

Add support for a new parameter in the implicit records templates:

- `except_record`: the template will *NOT* generate the `injected_records` for records matching `except_record`, even if they matched `each_record`.

Also added support for regular expressions in the matching, using the already available `!ruby/regexp` text in a YAML value. The object loaded from the YAML
will be of `Regexp` type, and will thus be used to _match_ the value, instead of being identical only. This is supported in both `except_record` and
`each_record` fields.

## 6.5.0

...

## 6.4.0

Add support for injecting implicit records into a zone based on a pre-configured template. Brief overview of template keys:

- `each_record`: the template will generate all `injected_records` in the template for each Record in the Zone that matches criteria listed here.
- `conflict_with`: if any Record in the Zone matches the criteria listed here, the template will avoid injecting any of its generated implicit records into the zone
- `injected_records`: the implicit records that will be generated by the template for every Zone Record that matches the `each_record` criteria
